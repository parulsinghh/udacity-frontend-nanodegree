          <p class="italic">Albatrosses are highly efficient in the air, using dynamic soaring and slope soaring to cover great distances with little exertion. They feed on squid, fish and krill by either scavenging, surface seizing or diving.</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li><span>Family</span>: Diomedeidae</li>
            <li><span>Size</span>: Upto 3.7 m</li>
            <li><span>Lifespan</span>: 42 years</li>
            <li><span>Mass</span>: Upto 8.5 kg</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Albatrosses are colonial, nesting for the most part on remote oceanic islands, often with several species nesting together. Pair bonds between males and females form over several years, with the use of "ritualised dances", and will last for the life of the pair.</p>
